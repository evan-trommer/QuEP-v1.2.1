# This file retrieves the fields from OSIRIS Quasi3D data files stored within the data/ folder.

# Coordinate System
# z   - Direction of laser propagation (longitudinal)
# xi  - Position along z relative to wavefront
# r   - Cylindrical coordinate around z
# phi - Cylindrical coordinate around z, define phi = 0 along x
# x   - Direction of transverse probe
# y   - Direction perpendicular to transverse probe

# Modes
# mode = 0 refers to LWF effects only
# mode = 1 refers to laser effects only
# mode = any other integer uses LWF + laser effects
